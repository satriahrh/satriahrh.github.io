Even in a big company, they tend to expect us to deliver the functionality on time. Even those mature software engineer and product manager, they only care about the acceptance criteria based on functionality like “the service enable the user to add product promotion to their online store.” Rarely do they care about the business value before, on, and after the development team delivers the product.</p>\n<p>In reality, the product manager or project manager or whoever delivers the business requirement always had metrics on their hand. And it is very logical, they won’t be wasting so much time just waiting for the development team to build a product. They have their math, after the product launch, they will certainly expect a growing number of users, revenue, or any.</p>\n<p>Knowing that they have certain metrics to watch, why don’t the development team don’t? And that will be what this article talking about: how to build a product that delivers high business value. Because just keeping our eyes only on product behavior and deadline won’t bring any good for everyone.</p>\n<p>As an engineer, I had passed those phases where what I only care about is the requirement from my product manager. They told me to build a certain feature that behaves like what they present using a prototype from the UX team. I just focus on how can I build the feature, in time. Rarely I ask him what metrics should we care about, how do will we be using the stored data, what is a certain expectation from the business team, what is the future plan for this feature, etc. I just don’t buy those kinds of so-called business things, as a fresh graduate who graduated with an informatics engineering degree I only care about the technical part because my role in this company is Software Engineer.</p>\n<p>Later did I know, my approach to building things only care technical part is so wrong. I read many articles, watch many videos, listen to agile coach said, software engineer, is not just coder. A software engineer is an engineer, and an engineer doesn’t just write code. Surprisingly, we had learned that when we were freshmen. You can google it, software engineering process consists of several processes that are not only coding (from Sommerville): requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, evolution.</p>\n<p>So given that I only care about the technical part, I literally can build a product with numerous methods using unlimited cost. But business just doesn’t go that way, your company certainly have a limit on investing technology and to support our product running well in production.</p>\n<p>My suggestion is that, as an engineer who is working on a development team, they should be watching not just the technical part of the requirement of the product they will be building. A software engineer is expected to conduct an engineering process to generate a suitable solution given so many certain and uncertain things to watch.;</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Build Product That Deliver High Business Value?","date":"January 02, 2021","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/33-my-writing-journey-starts-here-began-by-reading/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My Writing Journey Starts Here: began by reading"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/49-circle-of-safety-feeling-safe-at-work-and-home/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Circle of Safety: feeling safe at work and home"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a1c7a6ab-1c2d-55f5-84ff-49c9c45424c9","previousPostId":"85f0d8f3-cf59-5c3a-8641-702c4b61b5d9","nextPostId":"107d790b-87bf-5b81-9898-6ecc3a05cb57"}},
