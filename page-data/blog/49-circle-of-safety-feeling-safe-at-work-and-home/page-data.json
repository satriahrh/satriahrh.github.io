Something happening at the office that makes you feel depressed could affect you at your home, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Recently, I just bought a paper book named <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16144853-leaders-eat-last\">Leaders Eat Last</a> by Simon Sinek then I read it on my kindle (don’t ask how). It mainly tells a lot about a Circle of Safety, in how we maintain a safe and supportive environment everywhere to boost our productivity both at work and home.</p>\n<h2>What is The Circle of Safety?</h2>\n<p>SpongeBob SquarePants at The Camping Episode, you should’ve known this for sure. It is when SpongeBob and Patrick decided to make a camp in their front yard. Events after events, a sea bear bringing disaster to the club, and the only one that can save them from the attack is the anti sea bear circle.</p>\n<p>The circle of safety is like anti sea bear circle. It protects anyone inside from the danger outside, and making sure anyone inside brings no harm but safe.</p>\n<p>According to the author, maintaining a circle of safety will bring more productivity. The stronger the circle, the more productive the entire club could be.</p>\n<h2>How to Create The Circle of Safety?</h2>\n<p>The next question should you wonder is how to create it? And the answer is easy, by creating a borderline between the inner side and outer side. Don’t give me such emotion, I am being serious here :v</p>\n<p>But seriously, knowing which inside and which outside is the first thing the author tells. Though I haven’t finished the book yet, I become to understand what is it and why is it important to maintain it.</p>\n<p>Some people consider this book a leadership book, but I don’t think so. Knowing which inside and which outside is not the sole responsibility of the leader. Intuitively, we will keep everything that brings benefit to us as our inner side and brings harm to us as our outer side.</p>\n<p>The inner side should not make a frown on our face. The opposite, it should remove any sorrow from our heart when something hit us. You actually expect that from your parent, brother, sister, family, partner, coworker right?</p>\n<p>The outer side is a little bit tricky because the author tells us in national geographic style narrative. He is literally describing how the herd of gazelle is keeping away from the danger of starving lions. And yes, it is as heroic as you can (should) imagine.</p>\n<p>To create the circle of safety, it is actually needing an understanding of how we understand: (1) what brings safe to us in which we do not need any fear from it and (2) anyone that doesn’t belong to the inner side goes outside. The latter is actually a shortcut but is true though because the author also tells us that we live in a world that danger is everywhere and even everyone.</p>\n<h2>How to maintain?</h2>\n<p>Buy the book, thanks.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Circle of Safety: feeling safe at work and home","date":"January 04, 2021","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/36-how-to-build-product-that-deliver-high-business-value/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Build Product That Deliver High Business Value?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/62-acing-your-first-on-call-schedule-clear-report-on-every-second/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Acing Your First On Call Schedule: Clear Report on Every Second"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"107d790b-87bf-5b81-9898-6ecc3a05cb57","previousPostId":"a1c7a6ab-1c2d-55f5-84ff-49c9c45424c9","nextPostId":"4b9f08c1-c72c-53a5-bbb9-074cdb624698"}},
