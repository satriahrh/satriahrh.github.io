From daily private journey, WordPress blog (not this one), Facebook post, the last one is medium. And I now begin to understand what‚Äôs wrong with me. Why did I fail in those attempts? Why did I fail every time I tried to start writing.</p>\n<h2>I am not a reader to begin with?</h2>\n<p>That was true, it was. To understand why I am not able to transform my mind into words of an article is that I have no clue. What I can do is just endlessly thinking about how should I write my article.</p>\n<p>It is logical. A reader has countless experiences with words. They are exposed to different kinds of written expressions. Words are just a daily meal for them. They can say like, ‚ÄúAh this kind of expression is so ugly.‚Äù or any comment of expression the author used.</p>\n<p>Back in the day when I was writing my final college project for my bachelor‚Äôs degree, I was both reading and writing. In the first place, you should have read countless scientific papers on your desired (forced maybe ü§£) research topic. Then you conclude your reading onto your understanding, connecting the dots of how it relevant to your topic. Finally, you present your idea to your supervisor, first by writing it onto a draft of a research journal.</p>\n<p>At that time, I was surprised that I was able to write a college-level of writing. My writing is so good, not trying to be naive. The grammar mistake is not that bad. I got several reviews on my draft though, but that was due to no self-review from me. The thing is, I enjoyed writing my research journal in English, and cannot imagine I was writing in Indonesian.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the language, even if you are a native speaker of a language, you won‚Äôt be able to write if you don‚Äôt read. My research paper was written in English, and by that time I am a Javanese native speaker fluent in Indonesian, and English is only for reading college literature. I am still able to write in English because I was previously reading English literature.</p>\n<p>And now you will be surprised that I won‚Äôt be able in any way to write any passage in my native language of Javanese, the reason is that there is no literature written in Javanese üòÅ. So the conclusion is, read then write.</p>\n<h2>Am I a reader now?</h2>\n<p>In this language, I would rather say that I was only a reader. I live in Indonesia, where no one asks you to speak, listen, text in English. I read in English since the information to support my work on the Internet is not sufficient in Indonesian, then I run into searching for information using an English keyword.</p>\n<p>As a software engineer, I am working tightly with the technical documentation of the tools I am working on. It can be technical documentation of how to use a framework, how to do certain functionality in a specific programming language, or how to solve some kind of technical problem in a very specific development environment. That kind of information rarely be seen in Indonesian, there is no powerful forum like stackoverflow.com in Indonesian.</p>\n<p>I sometimes read an e-book in English, it is work related. For the same reason as above, there is now sufficient literature published in Indonesian. If I looked for an Indonesian book, there are many. When I was in college, I bought some college books in Indonesian. That was enough to pursue my college and help me to graduate, very successful before senior year. But the thing is different when I had graduated, exactly when it was senior year.</p>\n<p>A profession like a software engineer is not a common in Indonesia. I am (in the day I am writing this) pretty sure that software engineer hasn‚Äôt boomed yet. The industry demand wasn‚Äôt so big to accommodate computer science graduates. So the literature to pursue this profession is limited. Then comes to me book recommendation authored in English by English.</p>\n<p>Then I get used to skimming through some books. Wasn‚Äôt very good at the very beginning, just looking for something to check onto and never come back again to finish the book. But now, it is different. I am reading an English book like it is a novel authored in Indonesian.</p>\n<h2>Something change my reading habit</h2>\n<p>So many people wrote this kind of thing on the Internet. And may be I am part of them too.</p>\n<p>The answer is that I bought a kindle a week ago. Exactly a week ago, the kindle battery had only been charged once since first opened from the box.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt want to spoil anything now, since this is only the first week I am using kindle. I consider that this is may be still not valid enough to justify that I began to write from reading. People said that your habit is when you make it 40 days strike, and I haven‚Äôt.</p>\n<p>So let it be, let it be. As broken English by Indonesian said,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Keep calm and keep spirit</p>\n<p><cite>majority of Indonesian knowing this is a broken english</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I will come back after the 40th day of using kindle, with a review of me using kindle and how kindle really changes my life.</p>\n<h2>But why am I writing a blog now?</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Writing is part of the journey of every reader.</p>\n<p><cite>some people</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So here I am, I want to make this legitimated.</p>\n<p>Since I was reading, so many thoughts cross my mind. So many ideas just come out of nowhere. Made me frustrated every time those things pop out without any permission. That was also irritating since most of them such brilliant. And I don‚Äôt want them just to be wasted.</p>\n<p>It is not just what people said, although it was also one of the reasons that triggered me, it is about me wanting to make it as a creation. A creation that comes out from overloading creativity of me since I was reading. To not make those brilliant ideas and thoughts be a waste, then I want to make them useful to everyone or at least for me in the future.</p>\n<p>So, I don‚Äôt really care about anything in particular. Anything like how somebody earn so much ads that generate money from only writing an article each day, I don‚Äôt want kind of that. I am just needing a peace of mind. My writing wasn‚Äôt so good though, so I wasn‚Äôt expecting abundant readers to consume my writing.</p>\n<p>If this article is needed by them, let it be. Or else, let it be the artifact of my existence.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Writing Journey Starts Here: began by reading","date":"January 01, 2021","description":null}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/36-how-to-build-product-that-deliver-high-business-value/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Build Product That Deliver High Business Value?"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"85f0d8f3-cf59-5c3a-8641-702c4b61b5d9","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"a1c7a6ab-1c2d-55f5-84ff-49c9c45424c9"}},
